# photoGallery
A full stack implementation of a photo gallery 

This project was created a few years ago when I had a photography business. At the time, there weren't any good photo gallery solutions that were free, and had a minimal asthetic. So, I decided to create my own.

Functionality includes:
  - Automatically generates pages of images from an image folder
  - Shopping cart (Add and remove photos to a cart for ordering)
  - Credit card processing hooks
  
Written using:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - PHP
  - Javascript
